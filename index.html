    <p style="color: white" align="center">In Tears of the Kingdom, Link and Zelda explored below Hyrule castle to possibly uncover an explanation for the weird occurences in their Kingdom. In the process of exploring, they uncover a Mummified looking corpse being guarded by a glowing hand. Their presence accidentally faded the power of the hand and awakened the corpse of who turns out to be the demon king. The demon king then attacks the both of them decaying the Master Sword, weakening Link, decaying his right arm, and causes the chamber to collapse which leads to the dissappearance of Princess Zelda. Now without his sword, stamina, and heart levels, Link must save Hyrule and Find Princess Zelda</p>
